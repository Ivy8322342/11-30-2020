a
map 
array
key to index(hash function)
k%N 
every position is a linkedlist 
if empty you don't need to search

this kind of array called "hashtable"

A[h(5)].get(5)
first search array, then search the LinkedList

Collision handling->link

Seperate chaining ->easist

# but it wast space

=>Linear Probing
if collision, put it in next space

ex:get(39), %N first and search along until the first empty room

but it collides frequently

=>double hashing
d(k):7-(k mod 7)
ex:7-(21%7)=7

jump 7
